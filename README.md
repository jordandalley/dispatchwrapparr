## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Garbled/Green Video for DRM streams Dispatcharr builds 0.9.0-??

There is currently an issue with decrypting DASHDRM streams since the release of Dispatcharr 0.9.0.

Dispatcharr uses [docker-ffmpeg](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ffmpeg) as a build layer, which was recently updated to ffmpeg 8.0. The particular build of ffmpeg 8.0 used in docker-ffmpeg contains a bug which causes garbled/green video content.

This bug has been fixed in subsequent builds of ffmpeg 8.0 but is not yet part of the main release.

The solution at this stage is to download either an older or newer 'portable' ffmpeg binary and place it into the same directory as dispatchwrapparr.py. This is usually in `/data/dispatchwrapparr`.

Some options are:

- Jellyfin FFmpeg 7.0 Releases: Download the latest [jellyfin-ffmpeg_7.x_portable_linux64-gpl.tar.xz](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ffmpeg/releases) release binaries
- BtbN FFmpeg 8.0 Auto Builds: Download the latest [ffmpeg-master-latest-linux64-gpl.tar.xz](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) auto-build binaries with bugfix applied

## üõû URL Fragment Options

URL fragment options can be used to tell Dispatchwrapparr what to do with a specific stream.

***Important: When using URL fragment options, it is recommended that you remove "URL" from the "M3U Hash Key" option in Dispatcharr. This setting can be found in 'Settings' > 'Stream Settings'.***

Below is a list of fragment options and their specifc usage:

| Fragment       | Type          | Example Usage                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---           | :---          | :---                                         | :---                                                                                                                                                                                         | 
| clearkey       | String        | `#clearkey=7ff8541ab5771900c442f0ba5885745f` | Defines the DRM Clearkey for decryption of stream content                                                                                                                                    | 
| referer        | String        | `#referer=https://somesite.com/`             | Defines the 'Referer' header to use for the stream URL                                                                                                                                       | 
| origin         | String        | `#origin=https://somesite.com/`              | Defines the 'Origin' header to use for the stream URL                                                                                                                                        | 
| stream         | String        | `#stream=1080p_alt`                          | Override Dispatchwrapparr automatic stream selection with a manual selection for the stream URL                                                                                              | 
| novariantcheck | Bool          | `#novariantcheck=true`                       | Do not automatically detect audio-only or video-only streams and mux in blank video or silent audio for compatibility purposes. Just pass through the stream as-is (without video or audio). |
| noaudio        | Bool          | `#noaudio=true`                              | Disables variant checking (-novariantcheck) and manually specifies that the stream contains no audio. This instructs Dispatchwrapparr to mux in silent audio.                                |
| novideo        | Bool          | `#novideo=true`                              | Disables variant checking (-novariantcheck) and manually specifies that the stream contains no video. This instructs Dispatchwrapparr to mux in blank video.                                 |

Important notes about fragment options:

- Fragments can be added to stream URL's inside m3u8 playlists, or added to stream URL's that are manually added as channels into Dispatcharr.
- Fragments are never passed to the origin. They are stripped off the URL before the actual stream is requested.
- Fragments will override any identical options specified by CLI arguments (Eg. `-clearkeys` / `#clearkey` or `-stream` / `#stream` ).
- Multiple fragments can be used, and can be separated by ampersand. (Eg. `https://stream.url/stream.manifest#clearkey=7ff8541ab5771900c442f0ba5885745f&referer=https://somesite.com/&stream=1080p_alt`).

### üßë‚Äçüíª Using the 'clearkey' URL fragment for DRM decryption

To use a clearkey for a particular stream using a URL fragment, simply create a custom m3u8 file that places the #clearkey=<clearkey> fragment at the end of the stream URL.

Below is an example that could be used for Channel 4 (UK):

```channel-4-uk.m3u8
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 group-title="United Kingdom" channel-id="Channel4London.uk" tvg-id="Channel4London.uk" tvg-logo="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tv-logo/tv-logos/main/countries/united-kingdom/channel-4-uk.png", Channel 4
https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/dash_iso_sp_tl/live/channel(c4)/manifest.mpd#clearkey=5ce85f1aa5771900b952f0ba58857d7a
```

You can also add the cleakey fragment to the end of a URL of a channel that you add manually into Dispatcharr.

More channels can be added to the same m3u8 file, and may also contain a mixture of DRM and non-DRM encrypted streams.

Simply upload your m3u8 file into Dispatcharr, select a Dispatchwrapparr stream profile, and it'll do the rest.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Using the 'stream' URL fragment for mannual stream selection

Sometimes there may be occasions where you may want to manually select various stream qualities. The #stream fragment tells dispatchwrapparr to pick the stream that you've selected.

When first running any stream, the log output from dispatchwrapparr will display a list of available streams. To find a list of available qualities for a particular stream, simply run the following on the system running the dispatcharr docker container:

`docker logs dispatcharr -f --since 0m | grep 'Available streams'`

Once you've started that, play the stream then check the logs. It should show you a list of what is available.

`2025-10-14 19:44:01,863 INFO ts_proxy.stream_manager FFmpeg info for channel 86952480-4c6b-4df1-a60b-306e28a43cb3: [dispatchwrapparr] 2025-10-14 19:44:01,860 [info] Available streams: 270p_alt, 270p, 360p_alt, 360p, 480p_alt, 480p, 720p_alt2, 720p_alt, 720p, 1080p_alt, 1080p, worst, best`

Example: `dispatchwrapparr.py -i {streamUrl} -ua {userAgent} -proxy http://your.proxy.server:3128 -proxybypass 192.168.0.55,.somesite.com -clearkeys clearkeys.json -loglevel INFO`

### üí° Using the -clearkeys CLI argument for DRM decryption

The -clearkeys CLI argument is perfect for building custom API's or supplying json files that contain or supply automatically rotated URL -> Clearkey pairs to Dispatchwrapparr for DRM decryption.

Below is an example of what Dispatchwrapparr expects in the json API response or file contents:

```clearkeys.json
{
  "https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/dash_iso_sp_tl/live/channel(c4)/manifest.mpd": "5ce85f1aa5771900b952f0ba58857d7a",
  "https://some.other.stream.com/somechannel/*.mpd": "7ff8541ab5771900c442f0ba5885745f"
}

```

- A json file can be specified by just the filename (Eg. `-clearkeys clearkeys.json`) where it will use the file 'clearkeys.json' within the same directory as dispatchwrapparr.py (Usually /data/dispatchwrapparr), or an absolute path to a json file (Eg. `-clearkeys /path/to/clearkeys.json`)
- A json HTTP API can be specified by providing the URL to the -clearkeys argument (Eg. `-clearkeys https://someserver.local/clearkeys?getkeys`)
- When using the `-proxy` directive, be careful to ensure that you add your clearkeys api endpoints into the `-proxybypass` list if the endpoints are local to your network
- Wildcards/Globs (*) are supported by Dispatchwrapparr for URL -> Clearkey matching. (Eg. The URL string could look like this and still match a Clearkey `https://olsp.live.dash.c4assets.com/*/live/channel(c4)/*.mpd`)
- Supports KID:KEY combinations, and comma delimited lists of clearkeys where multiple keys are required, although only the Clearkey is needed.
- If `-clearkeys` is specified, and no stream URL matches a clearkey, Dispatchwrapparr will simply carry on as normal and treat the stream as if it's not DRM encrypted
